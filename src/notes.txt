Text Mask does not provide an option to unmask the model before storing it. The value
has to be sanitized prior to saving.

Passing the $event in the function exposes more than necessary and is not part of
  Angular's best practices.

Autofocus only activates when the page is loaded ( a known bootstrap issue: 
  https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/12525).  An angular directive can
  be written to handle this.

The array of data is used to easily demonstrate paging without needing to be connected
  to a database.  Code can be provided to demonstrate connecting this to a Firebase.
  
Paging was a useful means of displaying datasets when the design was centered on 
relational tables.  Today design is focused on speed and the user experience.  Leveraging
  observables and/or using GraphQL would provide a much faster and better UX
  when working with large datasets.
